### Alphabetical Testing

Able to get all required outputs to show, needs some efficiency tweaking but it works
---
06/25 Update: Included error checking on the open to close percent as the Stock Ticker has items that start with zero and that'll error out on the division

## Multiple Year

Needs error checking on the multiplication because it was dividing by zero at one point
---
6/25 Update: Appears to be working correctly

## Git Ignore

Tried to add the non-xlsm stock testing file to the git ignore, we'll see if it works
---
06/25 Update: git ignore didn't hide that file but it's fine I suppose
