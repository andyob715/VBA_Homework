### Discussion

There were a variety of ways I think I could have got to similar results. I know there are some inefficiencies in my code, but it appears to work. Specifically, the greatest and totals, using the match function, seemed inefficient.
I also noticed that some stock data didn't start on Day 1, which the directions stated "at the start of a given year", but it may have been interesting to start at the given stock start price (even though financial reporting would have used the start of the FY).
I hope I added the correct screenshots and vbs script, I had to google how to get the file saved as vbs and once saved could really only open in VSC.



### Alphabetical Testing

# Able to get all required outputs to show, needs some efficiency tweaking but it works
---
# 06/25 Update: Included error checking on the open to close percent as the Stock Ticker has items that start with zero and that'll error out on the division

## Multiple Year

# Needs error checking on the multiplication because it was dividing by zero at one point
---
# 6/25 Update: Appears to be working correctly

## Git Ignore

# Tried to add the non-xlsm stock testing file to the git ignore, we'll see if it works
---
# 06/25 Update: git ignore didn't hide that file but it's fine I suppose
